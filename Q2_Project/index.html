				<h2 id="topper" style="font-size:15px">Abortion is often seen as a taboo and therefore isn't talked about nearly as much as it should be. Abortion is healthcare and restricting women from accessing this is injustice. Just because abortion is prohibited, does not mean women no longer need it. Not only are the mothers' life being compromised to raise a child that they are unsure about, but the children whose lives are a product of a pregnancy that was supposedly terminated also have the chance of living life with a quality that is substandard. Abortion is healthcare and abortion should be accessible.</h2>
