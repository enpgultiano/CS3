                <p>  While every person has unique reasons for seeking an abortion, researchers have found that those who've had the procedure report a number of common factors that influenced their decision. Chief among them? Financial concerns. <br>

                    Other top issues that influence this choice are related to not being prepared to be a parent and the relationship with one's partner. <br>

                    These findings are the result of a five-year survey of people who have had at least one abortion and were asked to give reasons they chose to terminate their pregnancy. <br>

                    It's important to remember, however, that a wide range of factors affect the decision to have an abortion. These include very personal issues that cannot easily be understood by others or grouped into general categories. <br>
